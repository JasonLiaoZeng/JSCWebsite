    <h2>Introduction to C#</h2>
    <p>
        During this course, students will be learning C# and build serveral 
        projects with this language. However, many finds it confusing to learn their
        first programing language without knowing how the architect works. Therefore, 
        the lecture will first go over briefly on what is happening behind programing,
        then start with the basics syntax of C#.

            Takes a higher-level language's logic and communicate directly with a computerâ€™s hardware. Will be

            a special computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language).
            It's most important usage is to convert a higher-level language such as C# into executable machine code.

            a high-level computer programming language that implements objects and their associated procedures within the programming context to create software programs.

    <p class="important">Readings:</p>

    <p>
        Upon reading the definition section, student should understand how a higher level programming 
        language like C# turns into software. Through compiler, a higher-level language will be compiled into a 
        lower-level language, then eventually the assembly language matching their specific harware, then assembly language
        gets to be turned into machine codes that's executable by their processors.
    </p>

    <p>
        In modern days, most codes are written with higher-level languages beacause it is more productive, easier
        to debug, and works well across different hardwares.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another feature of many higher level languages to help developement is to be object-oriented. As defined, In 
        an object-oreiented language, coder must explicitly let the compiler know what type of object is attached to a 
        variable name.
    </p>

    <p>
        To give a brief example on one of the advantages of object oriented languages, imagine we have 2 objects, a dog object that can bark and a cat
        object that can meow. We now assign the dog object to a variable named Dori and cat object to a variable name Cathy. In an object-oriented language, we let 
        the compiler know that Dori is a dog and Cathy is a cat, so it's clear to the compiler that Dori must be able to bark and Cathy must be able to meow. But, in 
        a non-object-oriented language, the compiler won't know that Dori is a dog and Cathy is a cat, so it doesn't know what kind of option they can perform. 
        Such information could be useful when we are developing and debugging.

        <p class="code">// (Non-ObjectOriented) Python</p>
