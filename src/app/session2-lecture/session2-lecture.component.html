    <h2>Introduction to C#</h2>
    <p>
        During this course, students will be learning C# and building serveral 
        projects with this programming language. However, many finds it confusing to learn their
        first programing language without knowing how the architect works. Therefore, 
        this lecture will first go over briefly on what is happening behind programing,
        then start with the basics syntax of C#.

            a special computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language).

            Object-Oriented Programing Language
        </p>
        <p> 
            a high-level computer programming language that implements objects and their associated procedures within the programming context to create software programs.
            (It is ok if student don't know what this means and how this is significant after reading the lecture page, it will be explained later with examples)

        <p class="important">
            Primitive Data Type
        </p>
        <p> 
            the set of the basic data types from which all other data types are constructed.
        </p>
    </div>



    <p class="important">Computer Architects and Programming Languages:</p>
    <p>
        Upon reading the definition section, student should understand how a higher level programming 
        language like C# turns into executable software. Through compiler, a higher-level language will be compiled into a 
        lower-level language, then eventually the assembly language matching their specific harware, then assembly language
        gets to be turned into machine codes that's executable by their processors.
    </p>
    <p>
        In modern days, most codes are written with higher-level languages beacause it is more productive, easier
        to debug, and works well across different hardwares.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another feature of many higher level languages to help developement is to be object-oriented. As defined, In 
        an object-oreiented language, coder must explicitly let the compiler know what type of object is attached to a 
        variable name.
    </p>
    <p>
        To give a brief example on one of the advantages of object oriented languages, imagine we have 2 objects, a dog object that can bark and a cat
        object that can meow. We now assign the dog object to a variable named Dori and cat object to a variable name Cathy. In an object-oriented language, we let 
        the compiler know that Dori is a dog and Cathy is a cat, so it's clear to the compiler that Dori must be able to bark and Cathy must be able to meow. But, in 
        a non-object-oriented language, we won't tell the compiler that Dori is a dog and Cathy is a cat, so it doesn't know what kind of action they can perform. 
        Such information could be useful when we are developing and debugging.
    </p>
    <div class="code">
        <p class="code">// (ObjectOriented) C#</p>
        <p class="code">Dog Dori = new Dog();</p>
        <p class="code">Cat Cathy = new Cat();</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p class="code">// (Non-Object-Oriented) Python</p>
        <p class="code">Dori = Dog()</p>
        <p class="code">Cathy = Cat()</p>
    </div>



    <p class="important">Building Blocks of Higher Level Coding:</p>
    <p>
        Coding with a higher order language is like constructing a building, it is important to know what building blocks we could use.
        Although each programming language has their unique features and syntax, they are share these building blocks in common. The building blocks 
        shown below is the foundation of higher level coding.
    </p>
    <div class="definitionGroup">
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#x2022; variable, array</p>
    </div>
    <div class="definitionGroup">
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#x2022; if-statement</p>
    </div>
    <div class="definitionGroup">
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#x2022; for-loop, while-loop</p>
    </div>
    <div class="definitionGroup">
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#x2022; function</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        The meaning and usage of each of these building blocks would be explained below along with C# syntax.
    </p>



    <p class="important">C# - Variable and Array:</p>
    <p>Again, C# is Higher-Level Object-Oriented Language. Before explaining how primitive type objects are assigned to variables, we 
        must know its primitive data types, the most basic types that students should know are bool, char, string, int, and float. 
        Below is some example of assgining each of these types to variable.
    </p>
    <p> In C# and many other languages, coders can choose their own variable name, but there are some restrictions. Here are the rules 
        for choosing variable names:
    </p>
    <div class="code">
        <p class="code">//bool: stores true or false value</p>
        <p class="code">bool b0 = true;</p>
        <p class="code">bool b1 = false;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="code">//char: stores a single character</p>
        <p class="code">char c0 = 'A';</p>
        <p class="code">char c1 = '*';</p>
        <p class="code">char c1 = '5';</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="code">//string: stores sequence of characters</p>
        <p class="code">string s0 = "Hello World";</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="code">//int: stores integer values</p>
        <p class="code">int i0 = 2;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="code">//float: stores decimal values</p>
        <p class="code">int f0 = 0.2;</p>
        <p class="code">int f1 = 2.2;</p>
        <p class="code">int f2 = 2;</p>

    </div>
    <div class="definitionGroup">
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#x2022; The name can contain letters, digits, and the underscore character (_).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="definitionGroup">
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#x2022; The first character of the name must be a letter. The underscore is also a legal first character, but its use is not recommended at the beginning of a name. An underscore is often used with special commands, and it's sometimes hard to read.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="definitionGroup">
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#x2022; Case matters (that is, upper- and lowercase letters). C# is case-sensitive; thus, the names count and Count refer to two different variables.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="definitionGroup">
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#x2022; C# keywords can't be used as variable names. Recall that a keyword is a word that is part of the C# language. (A complete list of the C# keywords can be found in Appendix B, "C# Keywords.")</p>
